## Data Sources and Project Ideas

Below are five data sources related to geolocation and movement that I could use for exploration and analysis.

1. **Spotify Music Trends – See how song popularity relates to tempo or energy.**  
   - **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db] 
   - **Description:** This data Spotify API gives approximately 10,000 per genre. 26 genres a total of 232,725 tracks.  
     
2. **Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896-2014**  
   - **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games)] 
   - **Description:** find another data set and compare maybe population per medal scores of countries over time or GDP and medals percountry.  

3. **Trending YouTube Video Statistics**  
   - **Link:** [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new)]
   - **Description:** Super intersting data set haven't fully decided what I want to do with it yet.
   - 
4. **CO₂ emissions**  
   - **Link:** [https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions]
   - **Description:** Annual CO₂ emissions per country, along with related indicators like population, GDP, and emissions per capita.  
   - **Ideas:** Compare emissions trends of major countries over decades and explore relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions.

5. **FIFA Player Stats**  
   - **Link:** [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset)]
   - **Description:** Stats for over 18,000 FIFA players including age, position, overall rating, potential, and value.  
   - **Ideas:** Find which attributes predict high player ratings and Compare average ratings by position or league. Visualize player value distributions.
